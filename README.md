# Inboxes for Stream Deck

Stay on top of Inbox Zero with these Elgato Stream Deck actions

## Want to use these yourself?

I still have a few things I want to polish
before submitting these to the Elgato Marketplace.
In the meantime, you can install these locally.

1. Use `make link` to create a soft link between this repo and your Elgato Plugins directory.
2. Quit and re-open the Elgato Stream Deck Control Panel.
3. Add the inbox actions to your Stream Deck keys.
4. Set the tokens or passwords on the Stream Deck keys.
5. Enjoy that Inbox Zero.
